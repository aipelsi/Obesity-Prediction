# Health Trends Analysis - Obesity Impact Study

## Overview
This project, part of GEVB-X Data Solutions Inc., aims to understand and mitigate the impacts of obesity on the U.S. population. In collaboration with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, our team has applied advanced machine learning techniques to predict obesity trends and provide actionable insights for health policy and interventions.

## Objectives
- **Understand Obesity Trends:** Analyze data to comprehend the prevalence and incidence of obesity across different demographics and regions.
- **Predict Future Trends:** Employ machine learning models to predict future obesity trends and identify potential intervention points.
- **Inform Policy and Intervention Design:** Translate data-driven insights into actionable strategies for health policymakers and public health officials.

## Methods
### Data Collection
The dataset includes variables such as gender, age, dietary habits, physical activity, and genetic factors, sourced from various places including the UC Irvineâ€™s Machine Learning Repository.

### Modeling Techniques Used
- **Multinomial Logistic Regression:** Handles categorical outcomes of obesity classes.
- **Decision Tree Classification and Random Forests:** Predict obesity based on lifestyle and genetic factors.
- **Hierarchical Clustering:** Identifies patterns and groups based on lifestyle factors, which could be targeted in interventions.

## Key Findings
- **Predictive Performance:** The Random Forest model achieved a high accuracy rate, significantly better than the baseline, indicating robust predictive capabilities for identifying obesity levels.
- **Insights for Interventions:** Decision tree analysis highlighted the importance of factors such as the number of main meals, vegetable consumption frequency, and physical activity in predicting obesity.
- **Behavioral Patterns:** Hierarchical clustering revealed distinct lifestyle patterns that could be specifically targeted with customized public health interventions.

## Impact
- **Policy Formulation:** Insights from the project guide policy formulation, focusing on preventive measures and resource allocation for high-risk groups.
- **Intervention Design:** Data-driven insights allow for the design of targeted interventions like community fitness programs and nutritional education, tailored to the specific needs and habits of different population segments.

## Conclusion
The Health Trends Analysis project has provided policymakers and health officials with a deeper understanding of the factors influencing obesity. This enables the deployment of more effective and targeted health interventions, showcasing how advanced data analysis and machine learning can play a pivotal role in modern public health strategies.
